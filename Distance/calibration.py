"""
The main function of this script will write to the fixed location file, json/calib_info.json, the information pertinent to the distance_finder.py module
By running the main script on the example arguments specified below will yield the calib_json file to store the focal_length info to be accessed by distance_finder.py.

Example ARGS:
--base "C:\Users\Bob S\PycharmProjects\docs\Input\IMG_base.jpg" --calib "C:\Users\Bob S\PycharmProjects\docs\Input\IMG_calib.jpg" --known_height_m 0.124 --known_distance_m 1.0
...produces JSON of following format:
{
    "height_object_in_question": 0.124,
    "focal_len": 556.4516129032259,
    "dist_object_in_question": 1.0,
